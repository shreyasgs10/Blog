    <h1>Companies hire from these coding websites</h1>
<h4>Below is a list of some popular coding challenge websites with a short description of what each one offers.
programming</h4>
<h3>Hacker Rank :</h3> It boasts of about 2 million developers solving code challenges comprising four sections of Practice, Compete, Job and Leader board.

In Compete, you can sign up for contests or can create your own.In Job section, you can look for various job openings in your preferred area.In Leaderboard, you can look up to some hardcore programmers on this website on the basis of various contests.

<h3>Hacker Earth :</h3>  In addition to programming tutorials and practice problems, HackerEarth hosts competitive challenges, Hackathons and hiring challenges throughout the year. Its discussion section gives you a way to discuss problems and collab with other coders for the best solutions. So aside from a sense of personal achievement, what else might your code get you? If you’re a top challenge winner: cash prizes and the opportunity to land a new role. Before you sign up for hiring challenges, you’ll see company and role information, like location and requirements, plus challenge guidelines to give you a good idea of what to expect.

<h3>Code Chef :</h3> A DirectI initiated non-profit coding platform which was started in 2009. In 2010, DirectI along with Codechef started the ‘Go For Gold’ contest to strengthen the Indian Teams who participate in world finals of ACM-ICPC. The interface is user-friendly and consists of options like Practice, Compete and Discuss. The Practice section consists of problems categorized as per their difficulty level. The Compete section consists of various challenges in which users can participate as per their rating. On Discussion board, users usually post the problems which they encounter during practice or competition.


<h3>CodeForces :</h3>CodeForces is great for programmers who seek for fun challenges to build up their skills and join groups that suit their needs. The Gym feature is also very unique where coders can train their skills in specific challenges and see their standing at the end.

<h3>Sphere Online Judge(SPOJ) :</h3> Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) is an online judge that provides over 20k coding challenges. You are able to submit your code in an online editor. SPOJ also hosts their own contests and has an area for users to discuss coding challenges. They do not currently provide any official solutions or editorials like some other websites do, though.

<h3>Top coder :</h3>It is one of the biggest competitive programming online platforms in which users compete against each other by completing projects put up by TopCoder or by the companies itself. When you open the website, they give you options like app, website, chatbot, design, software development and to test as well as fix bugs. Naturally, this website is not for beginners but once you have developed a grip on programming, it will be easier for you to adapt to the environment.

<h3>Google’s Coding Competitions :</h3>The top-ranked programmers are given a chance to be interviewed and maybe even land a job at Google. These grandiose challenges allows programmers of all levels to gain experience and motivate them to do improve their skills for a spot in the finals.

<h3>Leet Code :</h3>One of the best online resource providing websites for programmers who want to crack the technical interviews.

The home page has sections like Explore, Problems, Mock, Contest, Articles and Discuss.

<h3>Codility :</h3> It offers tests that can be used to test the quality and the style of developers. The tests can be disguised as challenges, in a competition. Clients can design a competition where developers must solve a series of programming challenges. If you succeed in the first level, you can go on the level two and so on. The contenders who end up on top of the leaderboard, get a prize, and the information about the participants can be used to offer them a new job.
<h3>Code Wars :</h3> Code Wars is not the place for you if you are a beginner because teaching is less suited to code wars. For learners, it might be one of the best places for you if you have experience of coding beforehand. The website is full of programmers from US, China, and India so a diversified community of users.

<h3>Kaggle :</h3> These micro-courses boil down complex topics down to key components which help beginners learn the important topics and gain the necessary skills in no time. Their built-in code editor, kernel, is easy to use and great for beginners.
